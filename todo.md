Do I want the information returned from the prompts to be authenticated? How will I do the authentification? What if it's too slow using constant calls to openai? Do I need my own model/server? Seems like some information needs to authenticated and processed and modified at point of entry.

 I need the entire chatlog to be saved to the original database.

The current idealogy is using a language learning model to generate text responses based on previous text replies? Is that solid? What is wrong with this approach?

Task 1--
Collect information from the user with the ultimate aim being using that information to match people with each other. Should allow the user to upload photos as well. Connect fb, spotify? We need to understand which couples stay together, for what reasons and quantify the quality of the relationship.

 Task 2
 I need to provide guidelines on helping the user to date. I need to call openai to help with these guidelines. Not sure how to present them to the user. Through video or avatar? Will that be too slow?

 What information do I need? How do I ask for it in a creative way? In a storytelling format?
